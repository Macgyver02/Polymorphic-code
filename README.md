# Polymorphic Code

## 🚀 About



Polymorphic code is a type of self-altering code that changes its appearance each time it is executed while maintaining its original functionality. This project demonstrates an implementation of polymorphic techniques commonly used in cybersecurity, cryptography, and malware evasion tactics.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes only. The author is not responsible for any misuse of the code.

## 🛠 Features

- 🔄 **Self-Modifying Code**: Generates new variants of itself upon execution.
- 🔐 **Obfuscation Techniques**: Uses encryption and encoding to alter code structure dynamically.
- 🚀 **Real-time Mutation**: Ensures code changes on each execution, making static analysis difficult.
- 📜 **Customizable Algorithms**: Modify encryption and transformation techniques easily.
- 🛡️ **Security Research Oriented**: Useful for studying malware behavior and detection evasion.

## 🏗️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed:

```sh
python --version
```

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Macgyver02/Polymorphic-code.git
cd Polymorphic-code
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once installed, you can start the project by running the main script:

```sh
python main.py
```

## 📌 Usage

- Run the script to generate new polymorphic variants.
- Modify encryption settings in `encrypt.py` to experiment with different transformations.
- Analyze outputs in the `examples` directory.
